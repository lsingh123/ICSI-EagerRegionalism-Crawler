Scripting will still allow them to poke around your site. Additionally you\'d have to do it on all files, and change it every time a new one comes up.\nThis is a little complex, things can go wrong, so fully research before you drop in an .htaccess file with deny directives. Once you are familiar it, it as simple as creating a plain text file containing something like this, and naming it ".htaccess."

A lot of the time you can block a whole /8 but much of the time you\'ll be blocking /24 blocks so you\'ll need a lot of patience.

And the I didn\'t even talk about TOR or open proxies used to evade geo-targeting.\nIn general I don\'t think it works well enough to be of much use beyond targeting advertising to audiences (where it\'s no big deal if you miss a few).\nIf you want to make sure nobody from country X can access your site, I doubt it\'ll work.\nIf you want to be sure people of country X cannot buy your stuff (cause you don\'t want to ship there or have too much trouble with getting paid properly), ask the shipping address and if you don\'t like it, quit there.\nDon\'t forget the Internet is what it is in part because of the surpassing of obsolete country borders. All geo-targeting does is building in those borders again, and it\'ll backfire as the adopters of the Internet will not agree with you in the long run.\nwebwannabee\nMsg#:3495679\n8:16 pm on Nov 3, 2007 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\n\njoined:Aug 22, 2006\nposts:50\nvotes: 0\n\nHow to block china:\nHere is trick I used once and I don\'t know if it stil works, but the Chinese communist party blocks information regarding Tianamen Square; so what I did was to add a few links to Tienamen square along with anchor text regarding same at the bottom of the page and it worked.\nIt takes a while until their censors pick up on it but it worked 2 years a go when i tried it.\nmattb\nMsg#:3495703\n8:55 pm on Nov 3, 2007 (gmt 0)\nFull Member\n\njoined:Aug 21, 2001\nposts:206\nvotes: 0\n\nI echo the use of Geoip from Maxmind. We block pricing and cart from countries outside the US and Canada. It works well and does not slow down the pages. A subscription to the country database is cheap around $100 per year. The db is downloaded and resides on your server for fastest results.

I\'m in the UK and I\'ve blocked off the \'bad neighbourhoods\' from our servers for years and our spam level is as near zero as makes no difference and I can\'t recall the last serious attempt at an intrusion. Blocking potential trouble areas is the most worthwhile way for a sysadmin to spend time IMO. Of course you can never be 100% but it\'s like fitting extra locks to deter burglars, most of them will go off to find easier victims, and there are plenty of those unfortunately.

China in particular has the potential to cause a huge number of clicks but the "people" will never buy anything..

Then again you could block most of the spam via normal spam blocking techniques such as hidden fields, searching forms for certain keywords, searching forms for links, multiple form submissions from the same IP during a certain period of time, etc. I generally use CAPTCHAs as a last resort however if you add in CAPTCHAs you\'ll see an even smaller percent of spam getting through.\nPersonally I just don\'t like to exclude anybody who might be a valuable customer or community member.

Until then they are permanently blocked from all my company\'s servers, it\'s much simpler than trying to filter out their spam garbage, much of which is pretty disgusting and highly offensive.

I would opt for providing a stripped-down version of functionality for users from countries where problems originate.\n\nI personally have built my own system to use an open source IP-to-country database to determine where the users are originating. From there, I block some functions which do any types of writes such as comments, contact forms, or anything that doesn\'t have a read-only nature.\n\nFor me, I block China, Russia, Brazil, most of the Middle East and other countries in East Asia. For these users, I don\'t display comment forms, disallow any ajax and that type of thing. I won\'t go into the exact coding, but something like -- example in PHP:\n\nfunction display_CommentForm() {\nglobal $u_valid_location;\nif(!$u_valid_location) {\nprint("Service Unavailable");\n}\nelse {\n...\n}\n}\n\n\nmight do the trick while still providing content.\n\nOf course, you have to have the code to determine which country the IP originates from and define $u_valid_location.\ntopr8\nMsg#:4393084\n7:31 pm on Dec 1, 2011 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Apr 19, 2002\nposts:3294\nvotes: 27\n\ni block plenty of countries, i haven\'t noticed any ill effects.\n(ecommerce retail website)\nsmithaa02\nMsg#:4393090\n7:43 pm on Dec 1, 2011 (gmt 0)\nPreferred Member\n\njoined:June 24, 2005\nposts: 446\nvotes: 0\n\nAndem...pretty slick.

They get a special message which sends them on a spree of spamming other services like mine (they essentially get sent on a wild goose chase, some which put them immediately on blacklists) :)\n\nIf you plan on going the \'htaccess route\' and only if you know what you\'re doing and if you\'re running a version of Linux (or other Unix variant) which is setup to provide constant updates like RHEL, there might be a specific Apache module that might be able to help you.

Adsense is fully aware of the issue, but the reps I\'ve been dealing with have not really given me a solution.\n\nFor the last month, every day, I\'m getting a mountain of views coming up in my daily reports from Vietnam and India.\n\nThis traffic is NOT real.\n\nWhat I mean by that is this - there is little to no traffic from Vietnam or India being recorded by Analyitics or my servers.\n\nI blocked both countries (via Cloudflare) from even accessing my site, but the views from Vietnam and India continued to grow every day.\n\nI tried the same blocking method by way of my server settings and the same result, the views from Vietnam and India continued to grow every day.\n\nHere is the rub. I tried a simple test by taking down our Adsense ads for 2 hours. And yes, the views from Vietnam and India continued to build at a rapid rate.\n\nThere are no clicks involved, because they are not actually seeing the ads. This some type of hack that is taking place off-site.\n\nBecause of the blocking methods that I used, I\'m convinced that they are directly pinging my Adsene server with my publisher IP.\n\nBesides being very annoying since my RPM number is much lower than it actually is, I\'m worried that these views are affecting my overall CPC.\n\nThe Impression RPM is 0, Active View is 0 for these fantasy views from India and Vietnam.\n\nThe Adsense reps I spoke to believe someone is using my ad tags somewhere off-site. I only see one "unverified" site coming up that scrapped certain sections of my site and is using my ads, but they will NOT respond to any requests to take down the ads. Adsense is aware of the offending site.\nkeyplyr\nMsg#:4830551\n10:31 am on Jan 1, 2017 (gmt 0)\nModerator from US \n\njoined:Sept 26, 2001\nposts:8831\nvotes: 398\n\nThe Adsense reps I spoke to believe someone is using my ad tags somewhere off-site.\nI agree.

I\'ve already received 7K views from Vietnam alone in one hour:\n\n"If a URL displaying your ad code is not on your list of verified sites, ads will still show on that URL, and impressions and clicks will be recorded. However, advertisers will not be charged, and you won\'t receive any earnings for that site."\nkeyplyr\nMsg#:4830553\n11:34 am on Jan 1, 2017 (gmt 0)\nModerator from US \n\njoined:Sept 26, 2001\nposts:8831\nvotes: 398\n\nWell then you may just have to live with the altered stats, at least until the perps stop, sorry.\ndolcevita\nMsg#:4830615\n1:35 pm on Jan 2, 2017 (gmt 0)\nFull Member\n\njoined:Feb 17, 2005\nposts:287\nvotes: 17\n\nYou can always try to block IP ranges for specific countries:\n[edited by: martinibuster at 5:35 pm (utc) on Jan 2, 2017]\n[edit reason] Pls post URL.

Between all of my tags, I only had "44" views from Vietnam, but there were over 34K views on my actual Adsense stats when checking by countries, which indicates that someone or something is just pinging the Adsense server directly with my publisher ID and not seeing actual ads.\ndolcevita\nMsg#:4830869\n1:41 pm on Jan 4, 2017 (gmt 0)\nFull Member\n\njoined:Feb 17, 2005\nposts:287\nvotes: 17\n\nNot sure of you have used IP ranges block for country from url below:\n[ipaddresslocation.org...]\n\nBut if you have used then probably 95% of all visitors from that country will be blocked.

The other day I installed a free plugin for WordPress, then upgraded it to the paid API so I could block countries.\n\nI blocked all countries except for UK, US, Australia and Canada (my target markets). What were the results of this?\n\n1. My server load dropped HUGELY.\n\n2. My adsense revenue more than doubled the first day, and is way up again today.\n\n3. My CPC is way up since I got rid of all the low paying clicks from countries like India, China, etc.\n\n4. The scraper bot plague from china, russia, etc. has ended.\n\n5. My blog loads very fast now and has been very stable.\n\n6. I took Bill\'s advice and used the <meta name="robots" content="noarchive"> to get my content out of google\'s cache. I can confirm that it took a few hours and it was gone.\n\n7. I blocked the IA archiver thing in robots.txt with this:\n\nUser-agent: ia_archiver\nDisallow: /\n\nSome tips about how I\'m using this (aside from the country blocking):\n\n1. Turn off the Live Traffic feature until you actually need to use as it will use up more server resources if you just leave it on (not that it\'s that bad, but if you aren\'t using it why keep it on?).\n\n2. I set a very aggressive control for crawlers (lets you set different rules for crawlers and humans). If they violate the server rules, they are automatically blocked for one month. Yes, a month. Why? Most of these stupid crawlers add little or no value whatsoever to my sites. So I don\'t care if they can\'t access them.\n\n3. Verified googlebots have unrestricted access. So the server rules for the other crawlers don\'t affect them.\n\n4. Fake googlebots get blocked automatically.\n\nAnyway, I\'m a happy camper right now. The scraper bots have been stressing me out until now. I really didn\'t think of blocking foreign countries until very recently. At first I was afraid I\'d lose a lot of money, but after looking at my adsense performance reports, the amount was negligible compared to my target markets.\n\nI have to admit that I was very surprised that I ended up making more money, with less traffic. I was scared that my adsense earnings would drop, but they didn\'t.\n\nI have actually moving to a cheaper VPS since the load on the server is so much lower, I don\'t need the higher cost one I was paying for. So the blocking is going to save me about $25 per month in hosting costs.\n\nI hope this post helps some of you out there who might have had similar problems.\n\nBTW, I\'m not a server guy, so fiddling with server settings and filters isn\'t something in my realm of skill sets, but the plugin worked really well for me, and it was easy to use. I know that some of you can do the server voodoo stuff instead of using the plugin, but I can\'t.\n\nAnd thanks again to Bill for his awesome post and encouragement to focus on target markets and not be afraid to block foreign countries. Thanks Bill! :)\n[edited by: incrediBILL at 10:29 pm (utc) on May 8, 2013]\nfumanchu\nMsg#:4572062\n10:29 pm on May 8, 2013 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\njoined:May 8, 2013\nposts: 49\nvotes: 0\n\nOh, I also did a couple of other things:\n\n1.

That\'s good to know.\n\nWe\'ll see what happens with Google. My blog is linked to from prominent publications in its niche, so maybe that will help with google. I don\'t know.\n\nBut I am going to run this as is for a month or two, then I\'ll see what\'s what. I do NOT miss the foreign traffic server headaches at all! This is the first time I\'ve been able to relax about it for a while.

No matter how much technology you put out there to stop the scraping, the speed they would hit the server, asking for hundreds of pages a minute, because of it\'s database back end,could render it useless and a server than can\'t respond doesn\'t do anyone any good so I took it to the firewall but that\'s just me.\n\nSince then I\'ve also got way more horsepower and now cache pages so the site can sustain a much heaver load these days but the scrapers are also more powerful with bigger bandwidth than ever before so it\'s a wash.\n\nIf I were going to do business with Asia I think I\'d set up a second server and route all the Asian traffic to that box and let the rest of the world use one less abused server and Asia would just get whatever they get and I wouldn\'t worry about it.\nswa66\nMsg#:4572083\n11:21 pm on May 8, 2013 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Aug 7, 2003\nposts:4783\nvotes: 0\n\nThere are downsides to widespread blocking based on geolocation.\n\n- First what happens when a decision maker goes on holiday outside of your service area. That could be a huge OUCH if he can\'t reach it in order to see what\'s being bought. These things can break deals.\n\n- (most) search engines are global, they might eventually like you less if you block them too much\n\n- those in it for the bad things (scrapers, spammers, etc.) know dozens of techniques to work around it.\ne.g.: they use TOR, they use a shared webhosting platform, they use a VPN tunnel, they use a botnet, ...\nWhile it buys you some peace, they will come back with a vengeance.\nfumanchu\nMsg#:4572091\n11:55 pm on May 8, 2013 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\njoined:May 8, 2013\nposts: 49\nvotes: 0\n\nSwa66,\n\nNothing is foolproof forever. But many of these things aren\'t particularly "determined" bots. They are just hitting the server because they can. So blocking cuts down on the vast, vast majority of them. And that\'s really the important point.\nincrediBILL\nMsg#:4572098\n12:11 am on May 9, 2013 (gmt 0)\nAdministrator from US \n\njoined:Jan 25, 2005\nposts:14663\nvotes: 99\n\n- (most) search engines are global, they might eventually like you less if you block them too much\n\n- those in it for the bad things (scrapers, spammers, etc.) know dozens of techniques to work around it.\ne.g.: they use TOR, they use a shared webhosting platform, they use a VPN tunnel, they use a botnet,\n\n\n\nThere are products on the market that block TORs, and they won\'t tell you how they do it either. I could tell you how all that could be blocked, it\'s not that hard, just a little more challenging, but then you would know to much and be a threat to national security.\n\nIf you think I\'m kidding... <cue the black helicopters>\n\nHowever, back to AdSense, I think the sudden jump in earnings is smart pricing suddenly being confused and it has to dump out all the higher paying ads first. Since all the low rent traffic has gone away it probably gets initially lost and thinks your traffic is worth top dollar briefly before it recalculates the value of the remaining traffic which might take a few days/weeks.\n\nI my experience you\'ll come out with higher earnings somewhere in the middle after smart pricing figures it all out.\n\nKeep us posted on how it prices in a few weeks.\nswa66\nMsg#:4572104\n12:28 am on May 9, 2013 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Aug 7, 2003\nposts:4783\nvotes: 0\n\nIn a past life I managed a service dept that delivered services around the globe (new york, london, singapore, ...). I had staff working for/with me in those locations and in order to deliver the service we bought high end ICT gear.\nI had the choice where I bought it, either we could buy it centrally and ship it, get it through customs etc, or we could buy it locally and be done with it. Now for certain equipment we had deals in place with the manufacturer and for other stuff, we usually used a local supplier for speed and flexibility.\nI\'ve had a number of suppliers over the years removed from the supplier list due to them blocking me based on geolocation. Sure I could easily tunnel though our local internet connection, but it\'s a pain to have to do so.\nIf I can\'t see their stock levels, their pricing, etc and compare it to my other options - well then they will not make a sale.\n\nI\'ve ran into a supplier near Washington DC at a point that had a huge warehouse full to the brink of equipment but they for some silly reason assumed that not telling me their stock depending on where I was would be beneficial to their business. I did check it: if you had an apparent US geolocation they did show their stock levels, with an EU based one they did not show it. In the end they lost a lot of business just by refusing to show me their stock levels. They delivered fast, had a huge stock, where competitive on price, had good terms etc. But the extra trouble to be able to see their stock levels meant I usually went elsewhere. For one reason: it was simpler if I wasn\'t on a desk in the US.. .\nincrediBILL\nMsg#:4572114\n1:08 am on May 9, 2013 (gmt 0)\nAdministrator from US \n\njoined:Jan 25, 2005\nposts:14663\nvotes: 99\n\nPreaching to the choir.\n\nStill doesn\'t change the reality of the situation for me, fumanchu, and many others.\n\nYou decide which way you have to go, draw a line in the sand and that\'s how it goes.\n\nFWIW, most sites wouldn\'t tank under a heavy load unless it wasn\'t using a database in the first place, so for instance static sites wouldn\'t notice unless it was an all out DDoS. Plus many sites, like little specialized niche suppliers like you mention would be less likely to be targets of such activities in the first place.\n\nHowever, some suppliers are required to do such things because of their vendors not wanting pricing to be seen in other parts of the globe due to the differences in currency exchange, cost of doing business there, etc. That\'s why many websites, including Amazon, have things like "add to cart to see price" so it\'s not indexed and available to surfers around the country or globe without you going to each individual site and when you get there they may show you a geolocation specific price.\n\nLots of reasons for doing those things, or just blocking it to avoid the hassle in the first place.\nfumanchu\nMsg#:4572143\n4:50 am on May 9, 2013 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\njoined:May 8, 2013\nposts: 49\nvotes: 0\n\nBTW, Bill, I forgot to mention this. I\'m not exactly blocking the foreign traffic. I\'m simply redirecting it to...google.com! Heh. :D\n\nSo perhaps google will appreciate the extra traffic. I\'m sure they can handle it. ;)\n\nYou get that option when you decide to use country blocking. Block it outright, or redirect it.

Google has spent a lot of time developing targeted ads and giving advertisers accurate geo targeting tools. If they don\'t know how to use them then that\'s their fault. If Google wanted you to filter countries in AdSense they would give you the tools to do so. I\'m sure there are people that have valid reasons for blocking whole countries, but that does little against sophisticated attacks. Just don\'t go around telling people you\'re making more money because you blocked a bunch of countries, Google is very interested in that type of behavior.\nLeosghost\nMsg#:4577620\n11:49 pm on May 24, 2013 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member from FR \n\njoined:Feb 15, 2004\nposts:6717\nvotes: 230\n\nI think I\'ll tell people what I wish to ( incidentally I did not say anything about making more money by blocking countries ) ..( you imagined that I did ?..)( it says so nowhere in my post :) ..without any "input" from you..concerning what you think Google are interested in..:) or what you think advertisers should be doing..\n\nYou don\'t appear to understand "who is driving the bus"..and who\'s "input" Google care about..\n\nDoubtless you think that those of us who run more than one site and in different languages ( such as French or German ) are going to not block countries such as Indonesia or China from them..appropriate nick..the thing is..it is actually more complex than you think..as motorhaven illustrated..and as many hundreds of threads which you must have missed demonstrate and attest to..\n\nBut one thing that you can be sure of.."the banned" emails that people say they get..invariably mention" "risk to advertisers"..and many have had those emails after being hit by swarms of clicks from countries that advertisers did not target..\n\nOne can even hire human click swarms in such countries to put competing adsense sites out of business..same way as one can pay for link blasts to a competing site..\nnetmeg\nMsg#:4577635\n1:30 am on May 25, 2013 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member from US \n\njoined:Mar 30, 2005\nposts:12954\nvotes: 204\n\nThere\'s no Google AdSense policy against banning countries.

I have never dealt with anyone that does not use geo-targeting, it\'s their fault for allowing everyone in the universe to click their ads. Publishers have very little say when it comes to adsense, advertisers on the other hand...\n\nnetmeg, are you suggesting people are circumventing google\'s geotargeting and clicking ads within regions that are not targeted and therefore should never have been shown the ads? From my testing google does a very good job keeping ads targeted, even with cities close together.\n\nEither way, it\'s up to you guys if you want to block countries for the purpose of increasing your earnings. That\'s what this thread is about.

Lots of people use proxies. And many advertisers (specially the less-than-expert ones) don\'t bother to geo target at all, to their vast detriment.\n\n(I have a lot of experience with AdWords, moreso even than with AdSense. There\'s some as would call me a bit of an expert)\n\nIt\'s perfectly fine to block countries from seeing your site or your ads.

You can even "play safe" and redirect them to Google.com :)\n\nor..you could allow the entire world to access and click on the adsense on your tourism in Florida site..\n\nQuestion is ..do you feel lucky..\n\n*Similar scenarii would apply to other languages, and their expected traffic and ads..\nsimplo\nMsg#:4578321\n7:59 pm on May 27, 2013 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\n\njoined:Dec 27, 2006\nposts:51\nvotes: 0\n\nIf they are using vpns/proxies, does that not defeat the whole purpose of blocking the suspecting countries?

Your CPM may go up, but who cares?\nIf you have an extremely bandwidth-intensive site (or are paying far too much for bandwidth) then it\'s conceivable that the costs outweight the revenue from such countries, but IMO the resulting loss of goodwill, loss of visibility, the loss of inbound links will almost always make this a losing proposition.\n[edited by: jomaxx at 4:30 pm (utc) on July 4, 2005]\neuropeforvisitors\nMsg#:1336644\n4:30 pm on July 4, 2005 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\njoined:Oct 27, 2001\nposts:10210\nvotes: 0\n\nYou might be shooting yourself in the foot by blocking users from certain countries.

LOCAL in every country. If you\'re blocking countries then you are preventing Google from reaching their goal, for which you will no doubt be punished for sooner or later.\nI think it would be wiser to increase the exclusivity of your ad space by reducing it. If you were a newspaper that only had 2 pages of solid classifieds and you were the top newspaper in your town then you can charge a premium for listings. If you\'re a crap rag that features any old dross then surely you\'ll get just that- the rubbish that nobody else wants; including lower revenues.\nAdvertisers want to promote themselves, you want to promote your earnings. You have to give, to gain in this world. BTW, I\'m not flaming or picking on any individuals, just this strange mentality that is going around.\nmafew\nMsg#:1336653\n11:15 pm on July 5, 2005 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\n\njoined:Nov 23, 2004\nposts:89\nvotes: 0\n\nI see the logic in not serving google ads to poorer countries.\nIt\'s all about smart pricing.\nWe\'re better off serving ads to people who are going to convert for the advertiser, aren\'t we?\nClosedGL\nMsg#:1336654\n11:41 pm on July 5, 2005 (gmt 0)\nJunior Member\n\njoined:Mar 28, 2005\nposts:65\nvotes: 0\n\nSurely this control should be handed to the advertiser, not the publisher. There are a few forces to be put into consideration here:\nAspiration : People in poorer countries may not have the disposable income we have, but they may aspire to having it; likewise services we have here like better medicine etc should be in reach of all (do you not agree?). The internet isn\'t just in America, it spans the Earth. Google Ads are provided for advertisers to advertise their products and services to a wider audience, capping that hurts the advertiser who will pay less because the ROI lowers. You are effectively starving yourself.\nCrude Censorship : If my second language is English do I have less right to enjoy your content (assuming your content is in English). Similarly, is my capacity for clicking links that interest me reduced simply because your content is not in my native language? I\'m reading about iPods, Apple are advertising iPods; can I click the link please because I\'ve never seen one before.\nGet down off those pedestals, you\'re all so high it\'s making you dizzy. I really can\'t understand this mentality of producing websites solely for income from advertising programmes. Then to cap it all you block some of the very people that can make you that money, then wonder why Google throws you out because you\'re treating them and their advertisers like your #*$!es. Doesn\'t this smack of the get-rich-quick kids of 2000? Wake up baby, smell the coffee, that era has gone. Don\'t bite the hand that is quite clearly feeding you. Find better ways to help that hand feed you more.\n  Become a Pro Member\nJoin The Conversation\nRegister For Free! - Become a Pro Member!\nSee forum categories - Enter the Forum\nModerators and Top Contributors\nModerator List  |  Top Contributors:This Week, This Month, June, May, Archive, Top 100 All Time, Top Voted Members\nHot Threads This Week\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nJuly 2017 AdSense Earnings & Observations\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nIs it time to move on from Google?\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nIndexed pages keep dropping in GSC\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - June 2017\nSpeed up adsense to increase page load\nHome page with 2 links and serving two versions of a website\nFeatured Threads\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nTwitter Adds Advanced Filter Settings With Better Mute Controls\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nGoogle AdSense New Native Ads\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nGermany Passes NetzDG Law: Illegal Content Must be Deleted in 24hrs\nCanadian Court Rules Google Must Delete Pirated Products from SERPs Worldwide\nFacebook Milestone, 2 Billion Users\nGoogle News Makeover for Desktop\nFree SEO Tools\nSEO Tools\nSocial Tools\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Free Tools\nHire Expert Members\nMembers Seeking Employment\nCompanies Selling Services\nHire A Programmer\nHome Forums Index Google / Google AdSense\n\nPopular Forum Categories\n\nHire an Employee\n\nHire A Services Company\n\nHire A Programmer\nSEO Tools\nAll SEO Tools\nWebsite Crawler\nSE Comparison Tool\nOn-Page SEO Tool\nKeyword Suggest Tool\nImage and Link Analysis\nPage Comparison\nSocial Tools\nAll Social Tools\nAuthor Crawler\nSocial Activity Tracker\nEdit Social Images\nSocial Media Tool + Authorship\nYoutube Reputation Search\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Webmaster Tools\nHTTP Response Headers\nFind My IP\nWhois Domain Look Up\nWhats My Browser Size\nBlock Image Hot Linking in .htaccess\nMore Free Tools\nAll Free Tools\nSchema Tools\nPPC Tools\nWeb Design Tools\nOther Tools\nDisavow Backlinks Tool\nIn-depth schema code\nResources\nHome\nReport Problem\nLibrary\nHire Experts\nSettings\nLogin\nControl Panel\nSend Message\nMy Profile\nWebmasterWorld\nAbout\nNewsletter Archives\nSignup for our Newsletter\nFollow us!\n\n\xc2\xa9 Webmaster World 1996-2017 all rights reserved.

You should however know that the smaller the discrimination level you require, the larger the error will be. Especially with large ISPs like AOL which use a number of proxy servers to tunnel all client traffic through, it will be difficult to know exactly from which state a visitor is coming from.\n\nIf you have some knowledge in programming in for example PHP, a solution which uses a local IP database on your web server would be the simplest and fastest solution.\nAngelX\nMsg#:4173542\n6:36 pm on July 20, 2010 (gmt 0)\nNew User\n\njoined:July 20, 2010\nposts:2\nvotes: 0\n\nHi lammert,\n\nThank you for your reply and welcoming to this forum.\n\nI think I know what I need to do, but the problem is I have zero coding knowledge :(\n\nI need to use this program (it\'s free) to generate the required state\'s IP list:\n\n[maxmind.com...]\n\nThen I could use it in the following format:\n\n<Limit GET HEAD POST>\norder allow,deny\ndeny from 60.254.128.0/18\ndeny from 163.60.0.0/16\ndeny from 192.103.43.0/24\nallow from all\n</LIMIT>\n\nAnd just put the above in a .htaccess file on the root of the server.\n\nIf someone was willing to help me do this I\'d be very grateful. Not to sound cheap but I could spare $20 for it too (would probably take someone with the know how a couple of minutes)\n\nThanks again\nlammert\nMsg#:4174489\n4:55 am on July 22, 2010 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member from KZ \n\njoined:Jan 10, 2005\nposts: 2933\nvotes: 20\n\nHi AngelX,\n\nWebmasterWorld tries to be not a place to hire others to do work for you. There are excellent freelancer sites for that and you\'ll get much better response there. Our focus is to try it ourselves, get our hands dirty and actually learn something from it :)\n\nThe .htaccess file is located in your root folder of your webserver. If you don\'t have such a file it\'s easy. Just create one with the exact content you need to block your specific area and upload that file to your server with FTP. If an .htaccess file already exists on your web space, you should first download that file to your local computer, add the block lines to the top of the file and then upload it again to your server.\n\nIn most cases using FTP is the easiest way to upload and download files on your web space, but if you use a content management system on your site, it is sometimes also possible to edit the .htaccess file directly within your browser environment.\npoiuy\nMsg#:4174524\n6:52 am on July 22, 2010 (gmt 0)\nNew User\n\njoined:July 16, 2010\nposts:11\nvotes: 0\n\n<Limit GET HEAD POST>\norder allow,deny\ndeny from 60.254.128.0/18\ndeny from 163.60.0.0/16\ndeny from 192.103.43.0/24\nallow from all\n</LIMIT>\n\nAnd just put the above in a .htaccess file on the root of the server.\nIt is available!\nmaximillianos\nMsg#:4176127\n3:16 pm on July 25, 2010 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Dec 20, 2004\nposts:2377\nvotes: 0\n\nWe use a GEO database which we download for free every month (automated by a cron job).

Weapons, adult content, alcoholic beverages and gambling come to my mind as potential candidates for this kind of state level blocking.\n\nAnother more commercial reason can be if you have two websites, one targeting a single state, the other targeting the rest of the US. But in that case it might be a better solution to redirect visitors from the wrong state to an explanation page, or to the other site directly, rather than just blocking their access.\n  Become a Pro Member\nJoin The Conversation\nRegister For Free! - Become a Pro Member!\nSee forum categories - Enter the Forum\nModerators and Top Contributors\nModerator List  |  Top Contributors:This Week, This Month, June, May, Archive, Top 100 All Time, Top Voted Members\nHot Threads This Week\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nJuly 2017 AdSense Earnings & Observations\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nIs it time to move on from Google?\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nIndexed pages keep dropping in GSC\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - June 2017\nSpeed up adsense to increase page load\nHome page with 2 links and serving two versions of a website\nFeatured Threads\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nTwitter Adds Advanced Filter Settings With Better Mute Controls\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nGoogle AdSense New Native Ads\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nGermany Passes NetzDG Law: Illegal Content Must be Deleted in 24hrs\nCanadian Court Rules Google Must Delete Pirated Products from SERPs Worldwide\nFacebook Milestone, 2 Billion Users\nGoogle News Makeover for Desktop\nFree SEO Tools\nSEO Tools\nSocial Tools\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Free Tools\nHire Expert Members\nMembers Seeking Employment\nCompanies Selling Services\nHire A Programmer\nHome Forums Index Hardware and OS Related Technologies / Website Technology Issues\n\nPopular Forum Categories\n\nHire an Employee\n\nHire A Services Company\n\nHire A Programmer\nSEO Tools\nAll SEO Tools\nWebsite Crawler\nSE Comparison Tool\nOn-Page SEO Tool\nKeyword Suggest Tool\nImage and Link Analysis\nPage Comparison\nSocial Tools\nAll Social Tools\nAuthor Crawler\nSocial Activity Tracker\nEdit Social Images\nSocial Media Tool + Authorship\nYoutube Reputation Search\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Webmaster Tools\nHTTP Response Headers\nFind My IP\nWhois Domain Look Up\nWhats My Browser Size\nBlock Image Hot Linking in .htaccess\nMore Free Tools\nAll Free Tools\nSchema Tools\nPPC Tools\nWeb Design Tools\nOther Tools\nDisavow Backlinks Tool\nIn-depth schema code\nResources\nHome\nReport Problem\nLibrary\nHire Experts\nSettings\nLogin\nControl Panel\nSend Message\nMy Profile\nWebmasterWorld\nAbout\nNewsletter Archives\nSignup for our Newsletter\nFollow us!\n\n\xc2\xa9 Webmaster World 1996-2017 all rights reserved.

This thread has been most helpful to me over the past few years but I haven\'t really had the time to put a lot of it into practice. Search works pretty well on this site when trying to quickly nail down a set of ranges by colo or whatever (sometimes). Other times, the information is hard to follow through the threads.\n\nI don\'t know how any of the following could be accomplished but here are my thoughts on making this better...\n\n1. Separate out general how-to discussions (log analysis, regex, etc.) from actual host/agent/range info.\n2. I\'ve often thought that there needs to be an index and separate threads for at least some of these rascals. I\'ll use AWS as one of the more complex examples.\n\nSticky post with a\n1. quick summary of the AWS problem\n2. A maintained list of all known AWS ranges (with CIDR notation included). Use at your own risk obviously. Personally, I think there are better ways of dealing with AWS than trying to track it\'s ranges. But this would work for any colo I suppose.\n3. Options for blocking via host or agent information. You may find it extreme but blocking any host with "amazonaws.com" in it has a very dramatic impact and I haven\'t found it to be detrimental in any way to my operation (yet). I\'ve whitelisted a few things but this makes the point.\n\nThen let the thread proceed with discussions related to AWS.\nIf new ranges, are discovered, they can be announce here in this thread as usual but then added to the Sticky in the AWS thread. Bottom line is, it would be helpful to be able to find a summary of a service rather than have to look through reams of historical back and forth on the subject.\nAnyway, I know things like this have been wished for around here before and it\'s not really. I\'m sure I\'m being a bit naive about it but I know what bugs me about how this thread isn\'t the effective way for a beginner to get up to speed on the subject(s).\n\nEnough from me. I\'ll stop cluttering the thread with philosophy now and let it be what it is (which is useful if you\'re into this kind of stuff).\n\nThanks for all the info. It\'s the best resource out there on this subject.\nkeyplyr\nMsg#:4794512\n8:38 pm on Mar 4, 2016 (gmt 0)\nModerator This Forum from US \n\njoined:Sept 26, 2001\nposts:8831\nvotes: 398\n\n@ webcentric - of course blocking (anything) is a personal choice and what works for one person may not for another. Each web site has its own dynamic. I actually *did* block a couple world regions for a while until I learned to put together a comprehensive system of: header info, request behavior, UA and IP range. I found the prejudice of excluding entire geo regions was blocking a lot of users & potential customers.\n\nYes, I agree that long threads can be tedious to read through, but as you\'ve said, the search utility here at WW is pretty good, so IMO that\'s the best way to find specific answers. Some forums address some issues while you may need to read through other forums for the rest.\n\nAs for changing the thread hierarchy, or adding more stickys... of course everyone has their preferences but the evolution here has been organic to what works best for the most members.\n\n\nHere are a couple older threads discussing AWS IP ranges & blocking:\n[webmasterworld.com...]\n[webmasterworld.com...]\n\nFYI - depending on the type of site, blatant blocking of AWS (or any server farm, colo, datacenter, etc) may not be the best approach. A *huge* percentage of server ranges now include cloud computing which is used for apps & mobile connectivity. For example, both iPhone & Android Facebook apps use AWS, so blocking AWS without allowing these users through may not be the result you had planned.\n\nAs I mentioned above, what works best for *my* site is a comprehensive system of: header info, request behavior, UA and IP range filters, allowing some through while blocking others.\nwebcentric\nMsg#:4794843\n3:34 pm on Mar 7, 2016 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Aug 1, 2013\nposts:1338\nvotes: 22\n\n@keyplyr Again thanks for the feedback. There are a few things I keep in mind ...the type of system you describe requires certain skills and assets...\n\n1. Not everyone runs on Linux so using tools like .htaccess isn\'t even an option for many. .Net does have the web.config file which can be used effectively for certain things but that can get messy in a hurry (difficult to maintain).\n2. Many on shared hosting don\'t have full access to server logs. I know, get a better hosting company ;)\n3. Sites running on shared servers don\'t typically have a firewall available to them.\n\nI run such sites (and I\'m totally happy with my hosting BTW). I develop in .Net primarily on shared hosting and needed to be able to deal with this pretty much purely from a database and in code. I\'m lucky enough to have the coding and database skills to get it done but, as I\'m certain you\'re aware, whatever you build to manage the problem, it can take a great deal of time (not everyone\'s forte) and skill to accomplish.\n\nSo, bottom line 1 is that I\'m not arguing with you or complaining about the structure of this thread or anyone\'s approach. Bottom line 2 is that this thread is really a highly specialized topic that seems to only be useful to more-skilled webmasters/programmers (maybe I\'m wrong). I\'ve learned a lot here and will most assuredly keep learning. I appreciate everyone who helps keep this going and look forward following along as the thread evolves.\nlucy24\nMsg#:4794883\n8:09 pm on Mar 7, 2016 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member from US \n\njoined:Apr 9, 2011\nposts:13802\nvotes: 475\n\nmuch funnier than xtglobal\n\nThen again, few things are less funny than most of the robots that crop up in this subforum.\n\n:: back to working on my own behavior-based lockouts, whose code has now advanced one step further, to a site that is-- albeit rarely-- visited on purpose by actual humans ::\n\nadding more stickys\nNoooo!

Assuming, of course, that you want either of those things-- and if you didn\'t, you wouldn\'t be reading this subforum.\nwebcentric\nMsg#:4794980\n2:03 pm on Mar 8, 2016 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Aug 1, 2013\nposts:1338\nvotes: 22\n\n@Lucy24 -- If I understand correctly, htaccess is an Apache component and it\'s found most commonly on boxes running Linux. My point really was that folks running on a Windows server (for example) don\'t use this much if at all. Not sure if it\'s available on a Windows Server install of WordPress for example but who knows? Not me. All I know is that htaccess examples don\'t work for me and I have to use other means (in .NET, the primary tool is the web.config file). Still, even htaccess examples are translatable to other systems.\n\nRegarding stickies. I was thinking of sticky posts inside threads but actually all that\'s required there is to make the first post provide meaningful context to all that follows. So, maybe, never mind ;) Speaking of which, it looks someone (could it be our new mod @keyplyr) has taken it upon themselves to clean up some of the info here. Awesome! I think this will make searching and using this info so much more effective. Again, we\'ll see.\nkeyplyr\nMsg#:4795013\n6:21 pm on Mar 8, 2016 (gmt 0)\nModerator This Forum from US \n\njoined:Sept 26, 2001\nposts:8831\nvotes: 398\n\n@webcentric - you might reach out to dstiles with some of your questions regarding blocking on a Windows Server.

My point really was that folks running on a Windows server (for example) don\'t use this much if at all.\n\nApache comes in versions for all platforms. (Just recently there was a parallel discussion somewhere hereabouts, about case sensitivity in Apache depending on what platform it\'s running on.) I don\'t know how many flavors of IIS there are, and as for nginx, I can\'t even pronounce it.*\n\nYes, .htaccess is the part of Apache that can be used by individual sites when it\'s not your own server and you don\'t have access to the config file. (Which is presumably called that, or something very similar, regardless of server type.)\n\n\n* I know how they say to pronounce it, but the recommendation does not appeal.\nblend27\nMsg#:4795453\n5:01 pm on Mar 11, 2016 (gmt 0)\nSenior Member\n\njoined:Dec 27, 2004\nposts:1889\nvotes: 56\n\n@webcentric\n\nA lot of shared Windows hosting accounts these days offer Helicon ISAPI_Rewrite for IIS.

Takes much longer to manage the mail server (which IS linux) to combat spam and viruses.\n\n> It\'s is also my recollection that in the past few years you determined a more standard application of htaccess?\n\n\'Fraid not. I run Classic ASP which does not easily implement htaccess - it can do but it is (at least, was) expensive and per site not per server. I believe newer versions of IIS run a kind of htaccess but it would take longer to convert than it does to maintain this system and I would have to somehow include MySQL and a homegrown Control Panel.\n\nI have a home-grown ASP inclusion script which uses MySQL to store IP details and another script to hold UA, Referer etc info.\n  Become a Pro Member\n\nJoin The Conversation\nRegister For Free! - Become a Pro Member!\nSee forum categories - Enter the Forum\nModerators and Top Contributors\nModerator List  |  Top Contributors:This Week, This Month, June, May, Archive, Top 100 All Time, Top Voted Members\nHot Threads This Week\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nJuly 2017 AdSense Earnings & Observations\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nIs it time to move on from Google?\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nIndexed pages keep dropping in GSC\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - June 2017\nSpeed up adsense to increase page load\nHome page with 2 links and serving two versions of a website\nFeatured Threads\nFacebook and Google in Day of Action over "Battle for the Net" July 12\nTwitter Adds Advanced Filter Settings With Better Mute Controls\nMost of Your Website Traffic is Not Human\nGoogle Updates and SERP Changes - July 2017\nGoogle AdSense New Native Ads\nAre you ready for the Mobile-First Index?\nGermany Passes NetzDG Law: Illegal Content Must be Deleted in 24hrs\nCanadian Court Rules Google Must Delete Pirated Products from SERPs Worldwide\nFacebook Milestone, 2 Billion Users\nGoogle News Makeover for Desktop\nFree SEO Tools\nSEO Tools\nSocial Tools\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Free Tools\nHire Expert Members\nMembers Seeking Employment\nCompanies Selling Services\nHire A Programmer\nHome Forums Index Search Engines / Search Engine Spider and User Agent Identification\n\nPopular Forum Categories\n\nHire an Employee\n\nHire A Services Company\n\nHire A Programmer\nSEO Tools\nAll SEO Tools\nWebsite Crawler\nSE Comparison Tool\nOn-Page SEO Tool\nKeyword Suggest Tool\nImage and Link Analysis\nPage Comparison\nSocial Tools\nAll Social Tools\nAuthor Crawler\nSocial Activity Tracker\nEdit Social Images\nSocial Media Tool + Authorship\nYoutube Reputation Search\nWebmaster Tools\nAll Webmaster Tools\nHTTP Response Headers\nFind My IP\nWhois Domain Look Up\nWhats My Browser Size\nBlock Image Hot Linking in .htaccess\nMore Free Tools\nAll Free Tools\nSchema Tools\nPPC Tools\nWeb Design Tools\nOther Tools\nDisavow Backlinks Tool\nIn-depth schema code\nResources\nHome\nReport Problem\nLibrary\nHire Experts\nSettings\nLogin\nControl Panel\nSend Message\nMy Profile\nWebmasterWorld\nAbout\nNewsletter Archives\nSignup for our Newsletter\nFollow us!\n\n\xc2\xa9 Webmaster World 1996-2017 all rights reserved.
